      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dacarab.github.io/posts/2021/01/configuring-a-windows-answer-file-for-use-with-packer/&#34;&gt;last article&lt;/a&gt; in this series, we covered the answer file configuration and security considerations for configuring the WinRM service on the Windows template machine that we are automating through the use of Packer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will look at configuring the answer file to set the Administrator password and the time zone during the initial setup of the windows template VM.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>In the previous article we discussed the high level changes that we need to make to the sample answer file that comes with the Windows Server installation media, with a view to tailoring it for use with the Packer template file that we are working on.
In this article, we&amp;rsquo;re going to start to add that configuration by making the necessary changes to the FirstLogonCommands section of the answer file.</description>

      <description>In this article, we will cover the initial creation of a Windows answer file, which will be used as part of the Packer template file that we have been putting together in previous articles in this series. Future articles will discuss the additional configuration that will need to be added to this file as we tailor it to our requirements.
This answer file will automate the initial setup a Windows Server 2019 VM template in a vSphere 7 environment, which Packer will then customise to meet our needs.</description>
