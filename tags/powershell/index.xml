      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are often times when you are provided information in a report format that you need to do something with. For example, you may receive a regular report from your internal Security team that lists a set of missing patches or security vulnerabilities across your server estate, and you need to action the items listed. These reports are often produced in PDF format.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to manually pull information out of a report like this and turn it into a useable structure can be tedious and error prone - so having the ability to extract and structure the relevant information from the report, and use one or more scripts to then do something with it, can be very handy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
